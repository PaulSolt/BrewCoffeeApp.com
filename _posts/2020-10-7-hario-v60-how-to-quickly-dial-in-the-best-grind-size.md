# How to Quickly Dial in the Best Grind Size for Hario V60

How do you know if you have the right grind size? What's the best grind setting? How does grind size affect the taste, flow, etc.?

In this guide I will teach you how to approach your grind setting with more precision so that you can make **better Hario V60 coffee**. These approaches will work with any pour-over brew method, but because Hario V60 is more sensitive, I will focus on factors that make it harder to acheive consistency.

Hario V60 is harder to make than Chemex because you are brewing smaller amounts of coffee. Any time you work with smaller quantities, the small errors in weight can play a bigger roll in affecting the final brew.

But there are also some hidden issues that have been impacting the Hario V60 drain performance. I'll explore each of these topics below.

If you want to dig deeper, I will be **hosting a live workshop on how to dial in your grind size** (Details below). The workshop will apply to any pour-over method (I use Hario V60 daily, and Chemex for large batches).

## What Grind Setting Should You Use?

I have a popular [pour-over coffee email list](https://signup.brewcoffeeapp.com) (4,504+ people) and the 2nd biggest question I get is about grind size (just behind consistency). In this article we'll address both problems.

The best place to start is with the guidance from your equipment manufacture, but that may not be 100% correct.

For most grinders there is a bit of wiggle room around the recommended setting because there are more factors at play.

* For example, the Baratza Virtuoso grinder that I use daily at home has an internal grind setting. You have to pry off the plastic to access it, and depending on shipping the internal setting may be different grinder to grinder.
* There are also calibration inconsistencies from grinder to grinder, which is related to quality assurance.

All of these issues compound and make it pretty hard to give a one size fits all recommendation on grind size.

## Grind Settings for the Top 3 Grinders from Wirecutter 

[In 2020, Wirecutter recommends the three burr grinders](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-coffee-grinder/). I'll include the grind setting recommendations based on manufacture or the [Coffee Grind Size Chart](https://honestcoffeeguide.com/guides/coffee-grind-size-chart/):

* Best: Baratza Encore (Manufacture Recommendations)
	* V60: 13-14 
	* Chemex: 20-21
* Upgrade pick: Baratza Virtuoso+ (Manufacture Recommendations)
 	* V60: 15 (I use 16)
	* Chemex: 20 (I use 21)
* Budget: OXO Brew Conical Burr Grinder (Honest Coffee Guide)
	* V60: 4-6
	* Chemex: 9-11

If you're brewing Hario V60 or Chemex, these are the settings recommended as starting points.

I use the Baratza Virtuoso at home (older model) and use a 16 grind setting for Hario V60, and a 21 setting for Chemex. Your settings may be different, as my parents use 14-15 on their Baratza Virtuoso for Hario V60.

Honest Coffee Guide has a nice chart for almost any grinder. Here is the Virtuoso+:

**Your Initial Grind Setting is a First Draft**

Don't worry about having the grind size perfect the first time. Instead you want to be near where the grind size *should be*.

It's like writing a paper, you need to write the first draft before you have a paper you can edit. The paper doesn't need to be perfect, but it is a lot easier to improve something with a starting point.

You'll be making multiple "drafts" with each Hario V60 (or pour over) that you brew.

* Your Hario V60 grind will look almost like table salt — medium fine grind.
* Your Chemex grind will look like there's small "boulders" and will be medium coarse.

## Factors that Affect Calibration

There are more issues that can impact your actual grind setting. Keep these in mind as you brew coffee.

Your burrs will wear out over time. The more coffee you brew, the duller the burr's cutting edges will be.

As a guideline, I recommend that you **replace your grinder's burrs every two years** if you drink coffee regularly. New burrs can improve the grinding speed, grind distribution, and impact the flavor of your coffee.

Rocks in your coffee can damage your grinder, be careful you avoid grinding them (unplug before you try to remove if one gets stuck). I have a [simple workflow to reduce the chance of rocks]({% link how-to-protect-your-burr-grinder-from-rocks.md %}) using two methods.

Every so often check for broken parts. Some manufactures design parts to break much like cars are designed to crumple to absorb the impact forces in a car crash. I replaced a broken plastic burr holder (it improved my grind size distribution). 

### Baratza 180º Out of Alignment

If you have a Baratza Virtuoso or similar grinder, you may have alignment issues if you put the grinder burr on the wrong way.

It is possible to put the burr in after cleaning it so that it's 180º out of alignment. If you do this, you will notice the grind size distribution is incorrect for Hario V60. You'll start to see boulders when you should be seeing something resembling table salt.

Use the diagrams in your grinders manual to make sure you put it back together properly if it has user serviceable parts.

## Recipe Variables

There are a tremendous amount of recipe variables in a Hario V60. You need to become the machine if you want to have repeatable and consistent results.

If you want better coffee, the first thing you need to do is treat coffee like a chemistry experiment. The only way to know which variable is affecting the final result is to lock down all the other variables.

You should use the same exact water temperature, timing, brew ratio, bloom ratio, pour technique, water weight, and coffee weight.

The easiest and sure fire way to improve your coffee is to make sure you only vary one variable at a time. And that's harder than you might think because of three problems:

1. Hario V60 filters are notoriously inconsistent
2. Water adhesion can clog your filter
3. Your pour technique is a big unknown

### Hario V60 filters are notoriously inconsistent

For #1 when Hario had to increase production of their coffee filters, the manufacturing processes and materials changed.

They added new factories to keep up with the demand, and this has led to noticeable quality control issues — especially if you expect every bag of coffee filters to drain the same. They don't.

I first noticed drain issues with Hario V60 in 2018, and I thought the problem was me. It took me 8 months to track down the problem, and it involved me bringing my entire "coffee corner" to my local roaster ([[Joe Bean Coffee Roasters]]) to triage the problem. It worked perfectly in the store, but failed when I got home (and I even brought my own coffee, filters, and water).

I don't trust Hario V60 filters in the 100 plastic wrapped packs. They have been too inconsistent.

I only buy the 40-pack white filters, and I now drink better coffee because of it.

I discovered that even within a bag of filters, I could have one good filter and one bad filter. I dodged a bullet "selecting filters" when we played Russian roulette at Joe Bean.

Try my [Hario V60 Filter Drain Test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XEU2-6arI8) at home to see how your Hario V60 filters drain. A filter that drains in less than 20 seconds is good, I find my best drain between 11-16 seconds.


### 2. Water adhesion can clog your filter

Depending on how the Hario V60 filter sits in your Hario, it can stick, which creates a suction force that slows down the speed at which plain water can drain.

An easy fix for a slow filter is to fix the water adhesion problem by picking up the filter as it drains.

Next time when you rinse your filter, pick it up after pouring water into it. If you watch the speed that it drains ~180g of water, you should see it speed up.

1. Pour 180g
2. Watch the drain speed (water line)
3. Pour 180g
4. Pick up the filter
5. Watch the drain speed (water line)

I have brewed using the same paper filter where I didn't pick it up, and then when I did (after dumping the coffee grinds and rinsing the filter). The results were dramatic. The water adhesion caused the first brew to stall and my recipe didn't finish until 4 minutes. When I picked it up after rinsing the 2nd brew, it finished right around 3 minutes (my standard recipe timing for Hario V60).

This simple fix may even dramatically improve your results with "bad filters". [Tweet your experience](https://twitter.com/PaulSolt) or [email me](mailto:Paul@BrewCoffeeApp.com). 

## 3. Your pour technique is a big unknown

Even if you locked down all your variables, the final variable that is very hard to keep consistent is how you pour your coffee.

Repeating the timing as precisely as you can from brew to brew is super important. But you can't do this properly if you don't have a pacer.

In marathon races there are pace leaders who literally run with a sign that advertises what pace they are running the marathon. If your goal is to run a 10:30 minute mile pace, then you follow the person with that sign.

You don't need to run step-for-step, tripping over their feet, you just need to be near them in your line of sight.

You can do the same thing with your pour-over recipe using landmarks at specific timing.

Or if you want to get finer control, you can use a recipe app that will be your marathon pacer.

I designed the Brew Coffee app to pace coffee pour-overs with the Hario V60 and Chemex.

## Brew Coffee app

The Brew Coffee app can help brew a better cup of coffee using a known recipe. There are two recipes included, one for Hario V60 and one for Chemex.

[[Recipe Details render]]

These recipes were calibrated from my local roaster, and they work. Stop guessing which variable to tweak, and keep all your variables the same except for grind size (which will get to shortly).

## The Top 3 Hario V60 Issues


When it comes to Hario V60 there are three Hario V60 Issues that you need to address in the order from most impactful to least impactful.

1. Bad Hario V60 filters
2. The wrong grind size
3. Your pour technique

If your filters are bad, you can't make a good cup of coffee, and you won't be able to find the right grind size. It will be far too coarse in order to hit the timing because the filter is clogged.

No matter how you pour, if your grind size is wrong, it won't make a difference. These issues are orders of magnitude above each other. 

These three issues are far more important than any other variable in the recipe, including the brew ratio, water temperature, water quality (tap water vs. filtered), coffee, etc.

## The 3 Step Grind Size Dial in Process

Now that you are controlling all the variables — keeping them constant — we can focus on changing the grind size to find the right one for you.

Your goal with "dialing in your grind size" is to change the grind setting one notch at a time. The quickest way to find the right setting is to brew three batches of coffee back to back. Pick the brew that tastes the best out of the three (local optimum).

Keep in mind that this may not be the best cup of coffee you have ever had, but it should be an improvement from what you have been brewing.

Usually it will take doing this process 2-3 times per brew device that you use. You can apply the same technique to Chemex or other pour-over brew methods.

1. Pick a starting grind size
2. Grind coffee and brew a Hario V60 (taste and set aside)
3. Adjust the grind setting based on how it tastes and repeat step 1
