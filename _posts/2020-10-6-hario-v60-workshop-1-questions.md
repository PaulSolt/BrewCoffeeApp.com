# Hario V60 Questions (manual grinders, Android recipe, and ideal finish time)

I hosted a [Hario V60 workshop in August](https://youtu.be/kapT9Gt1PCc). Here are the top questions asked.

*Do you have a question?* Just reply on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PaulSolt) (or send me an email: [Paul@BrewCoffeeApp.com](mailto:Paul@BrewCoffeeApp.com)).

**Workshop 1 Questions**

* I have Breville Smartphone’s Grinder Pro - how do I find the IDEAL grind setting for proper grind?  I have been testing 47-52 settings!
* What temp do you like the water at?
* What's the ideal filter draw down time? I have 02 hario, the ones that came on 100x plastic bags
* Ready to brew. can we have the written recipe here? I'm on Android, can't have Paul's app 
* For normal coffee what is ideal pour time and total time to finish?
* I’m using hario mini slim pro, how many clicks do I use for v60?

**I have Breville Smartphone’s Grinder Pro - how do I find the IDEAL grind setting for proper grind?  I have been testing 47-52 settings!**

You need to do 3 brews back to back to try and dial in the brew. Set aside time on a Saturday to practice 3 pours using the same settings for everything except the grind size. For each brew, make the grinder coarser or finer. Taste test each against the next brew.

Try the same test the following week and see if you prefer one setting over the other.

You need to lock in all variables except grind size, so you need to use a constant time for the recipe.

**What temp do you like the water at?**

I brew as hot as possible. This means I'll heat up the gooseneck kettle on the stove if I'm at home, or I'll reheat water in an electric kettle to pre-heat the gooseneck kettle at work (I don't have a hotplate in my office).

**What's the ideal filter draw down time? I have 02 hario, the ones that came on 100x plastic bags**

For the filter test I like to see it drain in 20 seconds using 180g of boiling water.

Picking up the filter and repositioning it can improve your drain time. Not picking up your filter will make it stall at the end of a brew. I've tested the same exact filter, once not picking it up, and then a 2nd time (Yes I reused the same paper filter). 

It resulted in vastly different drain times at the end of a Hario V60 recipe. The only difference is that I picked up the filter.


**Ready to brew. can we have the written recipe here? I'm on Android, can't have Paul's app** 

Bookmark my Android videos so you can use them to help you brew coffee. 

* [Standard Hario V60 Recipe](https://youtu.be/tlRi2Z7iHSo) (2:30 pour)
* [Fast Hario V60 Recipe](https://youtu.be/44Z-IRzmIF8) (2:10 pour)

0:30 Bloom (start pouring after 30 seconds)
2:10 Pour (finish pour)
3:00 (finish drain)

* 21g coffee
* 340g water (212ºF - as hot as possible)
* 16.2 : 1 water : coffee ratio 
* 2 : 1 bloom ratio (2x coffee weight for bloom)

**For normal coffee what is ideal pour time and total time to finish?**

For Hario V60 my target is always 3 minutes for regular coffee. For decaf coffee my target is 4 - 5 minutes, decaf drains slower, even if you are more aggressive (use the 2:10 pour time).

**I’m using hario mini slim pro, how many clicks do I use for v60?**

I have not used this hand grinder, but I've used their other one.

[Online resources recommend 10 clicks for pour over.](https://howchoo.com/coffee/how-to-adjust-your-hario-mini-mill-coffee-grinder)

You may need to play around the recommendation area with a few test brews.
