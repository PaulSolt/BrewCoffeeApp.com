# Hario V60 Workshop 2 Questions

I hosted a [Hario V60 workshop in September](https://youtu.be/0wEMpQOBXps). Here are the top questions asked.

**Workshop 2 Questions**

* What is the total drain time from start to finish for normal coffee?
* Grind size is the hardest. It's definitely hard with my manual grinder. Any tips are appreciated.
* Not sure if my palette is distinguishing between good and bitter.
* When you finish the pour, should you stir the grounds right away? 

**What is the total drain time from start to finish for normal coffee?**

I highly recommend 3 minutes for a 21g Hario V60. Use the standard recipe in Brew Coffee and see how the results compare to your previous recipes.

If your drain is over 3:30 minutes, try and do one of two things. 

1. Adjust the pour to 2:10 from 2:30 (try this first)
2. Make the grind size coarser by one notch (try this second)

If your drain is super fast (less than 2:30 minutes)

1. Adjust the pour to be 2:30 (try this first)
2. Make the grind size finer by one notch (try this second)

**Grind size is the hardest. It's definitely hard with my manual grinder. Any tips are appreciated.**

There are guides and articles online about how to screw or unscrew the grind settings.

Try searching for something like: "hario v60 slim pro v60 grind setting clicks"

Replace the manual grinder name with what you have.

If you want repeatability I highly recommend having a dedicated manual Hario V60 grinder. Don't switch between brew settings with a manual grinder as it makes it very hard to get consistent results.

I highly recommend investing in a electric grinder if you want to brew multiple styles of coffee. Then you can use a number setting to quickly change methods. The Encore or Virtuoso are great, reliable and user serviceable grinders. Baratza has excellent customer support and replacement parts.

**Not sure if my palette is distinguishing between good and bitter.**

Over time you will start to pick up on the flavors.

Bitter would be like the pith on a lemon peel or taste baking soda.

Sweet tastes like sugar. This sense is what you're looking for in a cup of coffee.

Smooth will be very tasty — you'll want to drink more.

**When you finish the pour, should you stir the grounds right away?** 

Yes. Stir right away to make sure all the coffee will continue to extract. But don't over stir, the goal is to get the grounds off the edges of the filter. You don't want high and dry grounds.

I always stir the edges since I use a ceramic Hario V60 01. You cannot swirl the small ceramic Hario V60 without making a mess, so you need to stir.

The moment of inertia for the ceramic Hario V60 sizes makes it hard to swirl like Scott Rao. 

If you have a plastic Hario V60 02, it's easy to swirl. There's usually enough head room and the lower mass is easier to move in a swirling motion.

**Did you learn something from this workshop?** Did it make a difference in your daily Hario V60? Just reply on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PaulSolt) (or send me an email: [Paul@BrewCoffeeApp.com](mailto:Paul@BrewCoffeeApp.com)).

Talk soon and stay safe,
