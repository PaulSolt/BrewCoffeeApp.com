Brew Coffee is a pour-over recipe app for Hario V60 and Chemex. It has been in research and development since 2014. Up until now it has only been available for friends and family, but now I'm opening it up to additional beta testers like you.

**Pour-over coffee is difficult.** I had no idea what I was doing when I first used the Hario V60 in 2012, and the Chemex did not seem any easier.

Over the years I have learned that even with the best equipment it is very easy to mess up your morning coffee. Two fo the biggest issues are grind size (how fine or coarse to grind your coffee beans) and how fast to pour (too slow or too fast will make your coffee taste bitter or watery).

Being both a runner and an app developer I melded two concepts together as a way to simplify my morning routine. I needed a pacer to keep me on track with my pour, and I wanted to avoid the early morning math calculations (before I had any caffeine).

Using the app Brew Coffee, combined with the insights from Joe Bean Coffee Roasters, I was able to create the perfect recipe for my morning pour-over coffee. Day to day my results are more consistent, and I have been able to improve my craft as a home barista.

I encourage you to [sign up for the beta](https://signup.brewcoffeeapp.com), and you will learn how to finally make a great, consistent cup of pour-over coffee in the morning.

Thank you for joining me on your pour-over coffee journey. I look forward to hearing from you.
